<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An AWS VPC can be think of as your private corner in their cloud. It's like your home private network in their network.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is a logically isolated section in the cloud to provision resources.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is both flexible and secure, allowing you to control almost every aspect of your virtual network.</p>
