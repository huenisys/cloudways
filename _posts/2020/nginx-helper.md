<p>Nginx Helper is a supplement plugin when using Nginx's built-in FastCGI Caching. Without this tool, one needs to implement a way to force expire an existing cache entry that corresponds to a WordPress public object, i.e. any view that comes with a public URL.</p>

<p>No extra constant needs to be added in WP config if default cache location is to be used, i.e. /var/run/nginx-cache.</p>
