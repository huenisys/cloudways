<p>Ever needed to set up a Mail Sender provider for your WordPress install? Then comes <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WP Mail SMTP</a> to the rescue.</p>

<p>I tried <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mailgun.com/" target="_blank">Mailgun</a> but I was getting failures when adding a subdomain. Probably it has something to do with my account being free or not having any credit card info attached. Nobody wants to go through Support when you're just trying a should-be-ready-to-use service. I went <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://postmarkapp.com/" target="_blank">Postmark</a> instead and everything went okay.</p>

<p>This plugin comes with a pro version. I've got no clue what that's for but the unpaid version seems to do the basics. Another working plugin added to the list.</p>
